The definition used in this article might not be exactly strict; we focus on how these concepts are constructed.

Assuming we have defined the equal notation ‘=’.

# 1. Definition

A group $\langle G, *\rangle$ is a set $G$ with a binary operation $*$, and satisfies  
- Closed  
- Associative: $(a * b) * \mathrm{c}=a *(b * c)$  
- Identity element: $e * x=x * \mathrm{e}=x$  
- Inverse element: $(a * b)=(b * a)=e$

Why closed?  
Because the binary operation is closed by definition, we have the closure property naturally when we work with a binary operation.

Why associative?  
$(a * b) * c=a *(b * \mathrm{c})$ means that after the form of an element is determined, the different orders of operation lead to the same element. Note: This property is not universal, for example, subtraction operation $(a-b)-c \neq a-(b-c)$

Why identity element?  
So we can select every individual element, except the identity element, using a binary operation.

Why inverse element?  
So we can select the identity element using a binary operation. An inverse element is defined after the identity element.

A group $G$ is **abelian** if its binary operation is commutative, i.e. $(a * b)=(b * a)$.

A **ring** is a abelian group $\langle{R},+\rangle$ combined with a new binary operation $\cdot$, denoted as $\langle{R},+, \cdot\rangle$. The new operation $\cdot$ needs to satisfy  
- Associative  
- Left distributive $a \cdot(b+c)=(a \cdot b)+(a \cdot c)$ and right distributive $(\mathrm{a}+b) \cdot \mathrm{c}=(a \cdot c)+(b \cdot c)$

The new operation doesn't need to be as strict as the group operation, but still needs to have some properties. It is closed and associative by definition. Distributive makes sure the two operations are neither the same nor totally unrelated; they can interact with each other. The key point of $a \cdot(b+c)$ is not that $\cdot$ acts on element $(b+c)$, but how it acts with the operation +. Note that $\cdot$ is introduced after the abelian group $\langle{R},+\rangle$; it has to adapt to the world where + already exists, they are not equal.

We can make the new operation more strict, in $\langle\mathrm{R},+, \cdot\rangle$, consider the new operation $\langle{R}, \cdot\rangle$ :  
If it is commutative: **commutative ring**  
If it has identity element: **ring with unity**  
We denote the identity in $\langle{R}, \cdot\rangle$ as $1$, which is also called **unity**. The identity in $\langle R,+\rangle$ as $0$. Note that $0 \neq 1$, otherwise + and $\cdot$ will be the same operation. If $\langle\mathrm{R}, \cdot\rangle$ has inverse element for some $u \in {R}, u$ is called **unit**.  
If every element under $\langle R, \cdot\rangle$ has inverse element, expect for $0$, then $\langle R,+, \cdot\rangle$ is a **division ring** (or **skew field**).

Why expect $0$ (why we can't divide by zero in a ring perspective)?  
Consider $\forall a \in \mathrm{R}$  
By distributive of ring: $a \cdot 0+a \cdot 0=a \cdot(0+0)$  
By the definition of $0: a \cdot(0+0)=a \cdot 0$  
So: $a \cdot 0+a \cdot 0=a \cdot 0$  
By the definition of $0: a \cdot 0=0$  
It means any element operate $\cdot$ with $0$ is $0$  
To find the inverse element of $0$ under $\langle R, \cdot\rangle$, we need an element such that $x \cdot 0=0=1$, but $0 \neq 1$. So $0$ doesn't have an inverse under $\langle R, \cdot\rangle$.  
Tediously speaking, the identity element for the first operation of a ring doesn't have an inverse element corresponding to the second operation of this ring.

A **field** is a commutative division ring. Or we can define it from sets:  
A **field** is a set with two operations, denote as $\langle\mathrm{R},+, \cdot \rangle$, which satisfied  
- $\langle R,+\rangle$ is an abelian group, with identity $0$  
- $\langle\mathrm{R} \backslash 0, \cdot\rangle$ is an abelian group, with identity $1$  
-  $\cdot$ and + satisfy left distributive $a \cdot(b+c)=(a \cdot b)+(a \cdot c)$ and right distributive $(a+b) \cdot c=(a \cdot c)+(b \cdot c)$  
For example, Real numbers under addition and multiplication are a field.

If $a$ and $b$ are two not $0$ elements of a ring R such that $a \cdot b=0$, then $a$ and $b$ are **0-divisors**  
For example: Two matrices $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{A B}=\mathbf{0}$

Not all rings have 0-divisors  
An integral domain $D$ is a commutative ring with $0 \neq 1$ and containing no 0-divisors  
Loosely speaking, in an integral domain, if we want to get $0$ by $\cdot$, we must use $0$  
For example: Integer numbers under addition and multiplication are an integral domain.

**Ideal** is an abelian subgroup $I$ of ring $\langle\mathrm{R},+, \cdot\rangle$ under operation + . As for operation $\cdot$, it needs to satisfy:  
$\forall {r} \in {R}, \forall a \in {I}, {r} \cdot a \in {I}$ (left ideal), $a \cdot {r} \in {I}$ (right ideal)  
For example: Every integer in the integer ring is an ideal Intuitively thinking, the entire ring R can be "contracted" to the ideal I. The ideal is generated by some elements in its ring using the second ring operation.  
Geometrically thinking, ideals correspond to sets of polynomial equations whose solutions define geometric objects (e.g., points, curves, or surfaces). For example: The ideal $\left(x^2+y^2-1\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x, y]$ corresponds to the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

If an ideal is generated by a single element from $R$, the ideal is called **principal ideal**  
For example, Every ideal in an integer ring is a principal ideal.

An integral domain $D$ is a **principal ideal domain** (abbreviated PID) if every ideal in $D$ is a principal ideal.  
For example, The integer ring is a PID  

# 2. Use Case

Consider the Euclidean GCD algorithm:

```
EUCLIEAN(a,b)
1. A <- a and B <- b
2. while B >= 1 do
3.     R <- A (mod B)
4.     A <- B, B <- R
5. return A
```

Intuition: GCD is always a divisor of $(A \bmod B)$, this is the key property of Euclidean GCD algorithm, by iteration, we can 'purify' GCD from $(A \bmod B)$

But why does it work? Why is the final result A?

Definition: The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest integer $d$ such that $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$.  
Intuitively thinking, GCD is the largest number that has the ability to separate $a$ and $b$ into equal parts.

Initially, we are given two integers $a$ and $b$, which generate the ideal $(a, b)=a \mathbb{Z}+b \mathbb{Z}$. This ideal contains all integers of the form $a x+b y$, where $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y} \in \mathbb{Z}$.

For simplicity and WLOG, we assume $a \geq b \geq 0$

$\langle\mathbb{Z},+, \times\rangle$ is an integer domain. The ideal for $\mathbb{Z}$ generated by two integers $a$ and $b$ is:

$$(a, b)=\{x a+y b \mid x, y \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

The $\operatorname{GCD}(\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b})$ is precisely a generator of this ideal. It's the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination $\mathrm{ax}+\mathrm{by}$. If $\mathrm{b}=0$, $\operatorname{GCD}(\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b})=\mathrm{a}$

We also know that every ideal is PID in $\mathbb{Z}$, which means $(a, b)$ can also be generated by one integer. So every pair of integers has a GCD.

$\langle\mathbb{Z},+, \times\rangle$ is also a Euclidean Domain, which means for any two integers a and b (with $b \neq 0$ ), there exist unique integers $q$ (the quotient) and $r$ (the remainder) such that:

$$  
a=b q+r, \quad \text { with } 0 \leq r<|b|  
$$

  
So ${r}={a}-{bq}$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ . What we want is their smallest linear combination. We know ${r}<|{b}|$, so we've taken a step closer.

Because $r$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, and the ideal generated by two integers is their linear combination, so the ideal $(a, b)$ is the same $(b, r)$, where $a \geq b>r$, the sequence strictly decreases, $r$ will become 0.

When ${r}=0$, the other integer is the GCD we want.
