Welcome to contact me.

TODO: I didn't realize these essays are so reader-unfriendly while writing. I will polish them when I have time.

Nothing new is invented; I mainly focus on explaining and connecting certain concepts. Some ideas may be trivial for mathematics majors, I present them from an amateur's view.

# Summary:

[[Independent in BN Causal Diagram]]: I introduce some causal diagrams in Bayesian Networks(BN): `A --> B`, `A --> B --> C`, `A --> B <-- C`, `A <-- B --> C`, I use Conditional Probability Tables (CPT) to explain why some diagrams indicate (conditional) independent relation. 

[[AbstractAlgebra-1]]: Some objects in abstract algebra, I show how we add some structures to an object then it becomes another. And why we can't divide by zero from a ring perspective.

[[Category Product]]: Product in category is defined as a diagram, but why are the arrows pointing this way, and why is it the only reasonable choice?

[[Euclidean Distance Problem]]: Introduce the Euclidean distance problem, and how to solve it. 

[[Monoid]]: Often in mathematics, there are many ways to define the same object. Here I introduce three different definitions of a monoid. Although they look very different, they are describing the same thing.

[[Paradox]]: Some classic paradoxes and their explanations (unfinished). 

[[PCA]]: What are PCA and SVD talking about, and why do they work? 

[[PML brief note-1]]: How do we do machine learning using probability theory, take VAE for example. How do we generate something meaningful as the reverse process of learning (unfinished)? And some abused notations. 

[[Probability-1]]: How do we define probability, conditional probability, and random variable using measure theory (unfinished). Also introduce expectation and some abused notations. 

[[Product]]: Introduce product operation in vector, matrix, group, category. To what extent are they similar/different?

[[SDP]]: Linear Programming (LP),  Semidefinite Programming (SDP), and their applications. 

[[What is dx?]]: How to understand dx in calculus and differential geometry perspective? Why do we need a differential geometry perspective?

[[Yoneda Perspective]]: Yoneda's Lemma, and what it means? 

[[StatisticML-overfitting]]: The basic idea of statistic machine learning and overfitting(unfinished).
