About mathematics. The more I study mathematics, the more I feel it is a language. Like natural languages, it has nouns and verbs, they can be combined to convey some meanings.

The reason I feel we study mathematics is the same as we study another language: to communicate with people, to appreciate its literature.

Theorems are akin to literature in mathematical language, they are profound and beautiful. But unlike natural language literature, they are typically concise yet rich with thoughts, their meanings are often not self-explainable, living in ambient environment, revealed by interacting with other mathematical objects, which makes them sometimes difficult to understand. 

The magic of mathematical words is that they can be pieced together precisely and solidly as long as we know their 'shapes'. As our knowledge grows, we constantly find connections between fields where we don't really think are connected in the first place. These connections can be so strong and reliable that one field directly benefits from another.

I am trying to do translation between machine learning and mathematics, sketching the traces on both side, hoping to find something new.
