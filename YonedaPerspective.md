Recall Yoneda Lemma: For any functor $F: \mathbf{C} \rightarrow\mathbf{Set}$, whose domain $\mathbf{C}$ is locally small and any object $c \in \mathrm{C}$, there is a bijection  
$$  
\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F) \cong F c  
$$  
that associates a natural transformation $\alpha: \mathbf{C}(c,-) \Rightarrow F$ to the element $\alpha_c\left(1_c\right) \in F c$. Moreover, this correspondence is natural in both $c$ and $F$.

If we gaze at this equation for a while, we will find that it contains a lot of information. But surprisingly, this information is rather intuitive.
# What it means? 
$F: \mathbf{C} \rightarrow\mathbf{Set}$ is **any** (covariant) functor on $\mathbf{C}$
$\mathbf C(c,-):\mathbf C\to\mathbf{Set}$ is the representable functor at $c\in \mathbf{C}$. It sends an object $x$ to the hom-set $\mathbf{C}(c, x)$ and an arrow $g$ : $x \rightarrow y$ to the post-composition map $g \circ-: \mathbf{C}(c, x) \rightarrow$ $\mathbf{C}(c, y)$
$\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F)$ is the set of natural transformations $\alpha$ : $\mathbf{C}(c,-) \Rightarrow F$, each element is a family of functions $\alpha_x: \mathbf{C}(c, x) \rightarrow F x$ that is natural in $x$.

Yoneda lemma says for every object $c\in \mathbf{C}$ and every functor $F: \mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$ , there is a **bijection** between $\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F)$ and $Fc\in \mathbf{Set}$. The natural transformation $\alpha \in \operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F)$ is determined by $\alpha_c\left(1_c\right) \in F c$. 

Maybe obviously, but it is worth mentioning that this bijection not only set-level bijection, but also **natural bijective**, means that it not only preserves one-to-one match at each point, but the match also works uniformly when the point moves. This naturality is what allows the comparison between categories related to $\mathbf{C}$.


# Large and small
(We mean class-size and set-size)
$\mathbf{C}$ not necessary to be small just needs to be locally small, means $\mathbf{C}$ itself can be class-size.
$F$, or $\mathbf{C}(c,-)$, collapses $\mathbf{C}$ to set-size $Fc\in\mathbf{Set}$, or $\mathbf{C}(c,x)\in\mathbf{Set}$. 
So $Fc$, or $\mathbf{C}(c,x)$ is small, but $F$ or  $\mathbf{C}(c,-)$ consists one set(and one function) for every object (and arrow) of $\mathbf{C}$, can be large. 
Yoneda says that when the domain functor is representable ($\mathbf{C}(c,-)$ in our case), a natural transformation is encoded by one single set element ($\alpha \longleftrightarrow \alpha_c\left(1_c\right) \in F c$ in our case), so the whole hom-object ( $\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F)$ in our case) is small (isomorphic to $Fc$ in our case).
$\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(c,-), F)$ is set-size, but its member $\alpha$ is a class-size family $\{\alpha_x\}$. The gigantic family $\{\alpha_x\}$ is determined by a single set element  $\alpha_c\left(1_c\right)$. 


# Philosophy
An object is determined up to unique isomorphism by how all other objects map into (or out of) it.
An object is determined by its relationships to other objects.
Suppose we want to study an object $c \in \mathbf{C}$. For every object $c \in \mathbf{C}$ there are two functors built only from the hom-sets of $\mathbf{C}$ : covariant and contravariant. For simplicity we use contravariant:
$$Y_c:=\mathbf{C}(-, c): \mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}} \longrightarrow\mathbf{Set}$$
means all arrows into $c$ in category $\mathbf{C}$
Recall Yoneda: 
$$
\operatorname{Nat}(\mathbf{C}(-,c), F) \cong F c
$$
We suppose $F=\mathbf{C}(-,d)$, so for any two objects $c, d \in \mathbf{C}$, we have a natural bijection:
$$
\operatorname{Nat}(Y c, Y d) \cong \mathbf{C}(c, d)
$$
where $Y c=\mathbf{C}(-, c)$ and $Y d=\mathbf{C}(-, d)$.
The LHS $\operatorname{Nat}$ gives a functor category : $[\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}]$ , whose 
- Objects: functors $\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}} \longrightarrow\mathbf{Set}$. $Yc,Yd$ in our case. 
- Nat between functors mentioned above. $\operatorname{Nat}(Y c, Y d)$ in our case

In $\mathbf{C}$ we have $f:c\longrightarrow d$
In $[\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}]$ we have $Yf:Yc\longrightarrow Yd$
Bijection give us: $\boxed{f:c\longrightarrow d}\longleftrightarrow \boxed{Yf:Yc\longrightarrow Yd}$ 
Naturality gives us: $\boxed{f}\longleftrightarrow\boxed{Yf}$ , $\boxed{c}\longleftrightarrow\boxed{Yc}$, $\boxed{d}\longleftrightarrow\boxed{Yd}$
So we have a functor : 
$$Y:\mathbf{C}\longrightarrow[\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}]$$
$$c\mapsto\mathbf{C}(-, c)$$
which is **full and faithful** (determines objects up to unique isomorphism)
- "Faithful: different arrows $f, g: c \rightarrow d$ give different natural transformations, so $Y$ never loses information about morphisms."
- "Full: every natural transformation $Y c \Rightarrow Y d$ comes from exactly one arrow $f: c \rightarrow d .^{\prime \prime}$

Suppose we want to study $c\in\mathbf{C}$, $Y$ embeds $\mathbf{C}$ inside the much larger category $[\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set}]$, maps $c$ to  $\mathbf{C}(-, c)$ which means all arrows into $c$ in category $\mathbf{C}$. Because $Y$ is full and faithful, studying all arrows into $c$ is isomorphic to studying $c$ itself. 
Any object $c$ is determined by all its surroundings into (or out of) arrows.
